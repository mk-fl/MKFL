# MKFL: practical tool for Secure Federated Learning

MKFL is a privacy-preserving federated learning tool based on the xMK-CKKS encryp
tion scheme.


- *Client data security* is provided by the [xMK-CKKS homomorphic multi-key encryption scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06824) \[1\]. The parameters communicated between the clients and the server are encrypted using the aggregated public key and can only be decrypted by the collaboration of all clients.

## Installation
Works with **Python 3.10.12**.


1. Install the dependencies repositories *flower* and *TenSEAL* and install them:


```bash
cd flower
pip install .
```

```bash
cd TenSEAL
pip install .
```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
 cd MKFL
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install pyg_lib torch_geometric torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.4.0+cpu.html
 pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
 ```
 
## Usage
### Scripts
The **MKFL/src/FL** folder contains bash scripts to run easily the federated learning task on a single machine:
 - *fl_run.sh* : without encryption and without contribution evaluation
 - *fl_run_enc.sh* : with encryption but without contribution evaluation

Do not forget to replace the address of the server at the end of the *src/FL/fl_client_enc.py* or *src/FL/fl_client.py*.
 
### Manually
If you want to run each component manually, you need to run the aggregation server, the contribution evaluation server and the clients. 

To run the secure server, use the following command in **MKFL/src/**:
```python
python FL/fl_server_enc.py --nclients [number of clients] --nrounds [number of rounds] --filepath [folder path to store results] --dataset [split_scdg1] [--noce] 
```


To run the federated learning task without encryption, replace the filenames of the server and the clients by *fl_server.py* and *fl_client.py*, respectively.


Do not forget to replace the address of the server at the end of the *src/FL/fl_client_enc.py* or *src/FL/fl_client.py*. 

### Modify the database used

In the *init_datasets* function of *src/FL/main_utils*:
- add a branch with the name of the dataset
- create a Dataset object and provide it an initialization function
- call init_db on the new Dataset and return it


### Modify the model used

In the *get_model* function of *src/FL/main_utils*:
- add a branch with the name of the model
- initialize your model
- create a Model object and provide your model to it
- return the Model object


## Docker Installation and Usage

Docker image can be created with
```bash
docker build ./ -t ccaflr
```
Note that the build takes about 25-30 minutes.

To run the **secure** federated learning framework (without contribution evaluation) on a single machine docker compose can be used
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

*.env* file contains parameters for docker compose: number of clients, number of rounds, dataset name, model name, path to the dataset, and path to a folder to output results.
Latest execution logs can be checked with
```bash
docker compose logs
```

## Examples
Example datasets are provided in *src/databases*.

The first one is the directory *examples_samy*. It contains graphical representation of malware. The dataset to give as parameter is *example_samy* and the model is *GINE*.

The second dataset is *example_images.zip*. It contains image representations of malware. It should first be unzipped in a folder of the same name. The dataset to give as parameter is *example_images* and the model is *images*.
